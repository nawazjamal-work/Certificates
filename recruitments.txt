If you are seeking employment in the UAE from your home country, it is advisable to begin with reputable recruitment agencies.

Many professionals encounter difficulties in UAE job hunting due to a lack of knowledge regarding the appropriate channels to connect with recruiters.

Here is a list of well-known UAE recruitment agencies that you can approach (using publicly available contacts):

* Hays UAE: dubai@hays.com
* Michael Page UAE: dubai@michaelpage.ae
* Robert Half UAE: dubai@roberthalf.ae
* Adecco Middle East: info@adecco.ae
* BAC Middle East: recruitment@bacme.com

* ManpowerGroup UAE: info@manpower.ae
* TASC Outsourcing: careers@tascoutsourcing.com
* NADIA Global: cv@nadiaglobal.com

It is important to engage with these agencies beyond sending emails. Consider following them on LinkedIn, connecting with recruiters and consultants, sending concise professional messages, and engaging with their posts by liking, commenting and remaining visible.

Before reaching out, consider the following tips:
* Use a clear subject line (e.g., Job Title | Experience | UAE)
* Keep your CV in UAE-style format (1–2 pages, results-focused)
* Maintain consistency rather than aggression

While recruitment agencies will not guarantee employment overnight, they can significantly enhance your chances when used strategically.
